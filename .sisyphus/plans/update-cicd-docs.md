# Plan: Update CI/CD Documentation

## Context
`README.md` was outdated and did not reflect the split deployment architecture (Cloudflare Pages + VPS). `docs/CICD.md` was already correct.

## Objectives
1.  Update `README.md` to describe the split architecture.
2.  Ensure consistency between `README.md` and `docs/CICD.md`.

## Execution Steps
- [x] **Analyze**: Identify outdated sections in `README.md`.
- [x] **Update**: Rewrite CI/CD section in `README.md` to mention Cloudflare Pages and VPS separation.
- [x] **Verify**: Ensure content aligns with `docs/CICD.md` and `deploy.yml`.
